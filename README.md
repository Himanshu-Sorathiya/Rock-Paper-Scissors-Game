# Rock Paper Scissors Game

## Overview

This game features two hands that start in a neutral positionâ€”one representing the user and one representing the system. The user can select one of three options: rock, paper, or scissors. After selecting an option, both hands shake for 3 seconds, and then the hands reveal the choices made by the user and the system. The result is displayed based on the rules of the game.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: The user can select rock, paper, or scissors, and the result is dynamically calculated based on the selection.
- **Shaky Animation**: After a selection is made, a shaky animation on the hands creates anticipation before revealing the result.
- **Randomized System Choice**: The system randomly selects one of the three options to play against the user.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the basic structure of the game.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and animations.
- **TypeScript**: For game logic and functionality.
